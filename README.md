Coming up with recipes with some random ingredients is hard. You have a tomato
here and some sauce there, and the concept of food is nowhere in sight. That is
where Recipeasy comes in and gives you recommendations based on the things
that you have. Recipeasy gives you specific recipes only for the ingredients you have
based on your preferences using our “What Can I Make with This?” feature. Using
Recipeasy makes learning new recipes easy. It also can be used for recipe
cataloging – never wasting time looking for or losing a recipe again! The days of
Grandma’s recipe binder are over welcome to the future! Wanting to push the limits
of your culinary skills? Find inspiration with the Surprise Me! feature or search for
specific highly rated recipes that others on the platform have uploaded!

**Objectives**

• Design simple UI that allows users to view suggested recipes based on preferences

• Implement recipe library to allow users to save their favorite recipes and organize
them by category or create custom recipe playlist (ex: “spooky season”)

• Implement database to keep track of users and their preferred foods

• Food allergies filter

• Recipe rating system

• Surprise me feature gives a random recipe



**Scope**

• The project will focus on giving recipe recommendations for individual users. Core
features include the ability to save recipes, search for recommendations of new
recipes, and the ability to filter foods out based on allergies. Things that are not in
scope are interactions between users and artificial intelligence scanning fridges for
food.
