Documentation Lead: Nathan Fischer

Coming up with recipes with some random ingredients is hard. You have a tomato
here and some sauce there, and the concept of food is nowhere in sight. That is
where Recipeasy comes in and gives you recommendations based on the things
that you have. Recipeasy gives you specific recipes only for the ingredients you
want to use. Using Recipeasy makes learning new recipes easy. It also can be used 
for recipe cataloging – never wasting time looking for or losing a recipe again! The days of
Grandma’s recipe binder are over welcome to the future! Wanting to push the limits
of your culinary skills? Find inspiration with the Surprise Me! feature or search
recipes by their name!

**Objectives**

• Design simple UI that allows users to view suggested recipes based on preferences

• Recipe names filter

• Recipes based on ingredient filter

• Surprise me feature gives a random recipe



**Scope**

• The project will focus on giving recipe recommendations for individual users. Core
features include search for recommendations of newrecipes, and the ability to filter 
foods for the ingredients they want. Things that are not in scope are interactions between 
users and artificial intelligence scanning fridges for food.
